# Passive-Recon-Serock
# OSINT & Passive Reconnaissance Audit: serock.pl

## 🎯 Project Overview
An educational security audit focused on gathering actionable intelligence about the `serock.pl` domain. [cite_start]The goal was to map the attack surface using exclusively **passive reconnaissance** techniques to ensure zero footprint on the target's infrastructure.

## 🛠️ Tools & Methodology
* [cite_start]**Subdomain Enumeration:** Discovered hidden assets using `Subfinder` and `crt.sh`.
* [cite_start]**Fingerprinting:** Identified the technology stack (Joomla CMS, Apache Server) via `Wappalyzer`.
* [cite_start]**Network Mapping:** Analyzed DNS records (A, MX, NS) and WHOIS data.
* [cite_start]**Metadata Analysis:** Used `Exiftool` to extract sensitive information from publicly available documents.

## 🔍 Key Findings
* [cite_start]**Infrastructure Mapping:** Successful identification of subdomains and IP addresses.
* [cite_start]**System Profiling:** Mapped specific software versions for potential vulnerability correlation.
* [cite_start]**Data Leaks:** Identified metadata in public files that could be used for social engineering or targeted attacks.
