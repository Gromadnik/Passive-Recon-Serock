# Passive Reconnaissance & OSINT Audit | serock.pl

## Project Overview
[cite_start]Comprehensive security audit of a public sector domain focusing on passive reconnaissance techniques to identify the attack surface without direct interaction with the target's infrastructure.

## Tools Used
* **Subdomain Enumeration:** Subfinder, crt.sh.
* **Technology Profiling:** Wappalyzer (identified Joomla CMS, Apache server).
* **Information Gathering:** WHOIS, DNS record analysis (A, MX, NS).
* **Metadata Analysis:** Exiftool (analyzing public documents for sensitive leaks).

## Key Findings
* Identified active subdomains and mapped the DNS infrastructure.
* Discovered specific software versions used in the CMS and web server.
* Analyzed public files for metadata leaks (potential author names/software paths).

## Disclaimer
This project was conducted for educational purposes only. All techniques used were passive and complied with ethical standards.
